# Cosmic Drift VR - Contest Submission

## Project Overview

Cosmic Drift VR is an immersive space exploration experience optimized for the Oculus Quest 2 (Meta Quest 2) and built entirely using WebXR technology. Players drift through a procedurally generated cosmic environment, exploring celestial bodies and experiencing the wonders of space.

## Key Features

1. **Quest 2 Optimization**
   - Foveated rendering with dynamic quality scaling
   - Performance-first approach with low-poly assets
   - Efficient shaders and particle systems

2. **WebXR Technology**
   - Browser-based experience (no installation required)
   - Compatible with Oculus Browser on Quest 2
   - Graceful fallbacks for non-VR browsers

3. **Interactive Celestial Objects**
   - Procedurally generated planets, stars, and asteroids
   - Unique properties and appearances for each object
   - Teleportation-based movement system

4. **Dynamic Particle Systems**
   - Optimized space dust and nebula effects
   - Low-impact visual enhancements
   - Creates immersive atmosphere

5. **Performance Testing**
   - Built-in compatibility and performance checker
   - Dynamic quality adjustments based on device
   - Specific optimizations for Quest 2

## Technical Implementation

The project uses a minimal technology stack to ensure maximum performance:

- **A-Frame**: Core WebXR framework
- **Three.js**: For custom visual effects and optimizations
- **Pure JavaScript**: No heavy frameworks or libraries
- **GitHub Pages**: For easy web-based deployment

## Performance Considerations

Special attention was paid to performance optimization for Quest 2:

1. **Rendering Optimizations**
   - Reduced draw calls through instancing
   - Limited polygon count for all objects
   - Strategic use of foveated rendering

2. **Memory Management**
   - Pooled object reuse
   - Deferred loading of assets
   - Efficient texture management

3. **Dynamic Quality Scaling**
   - Automatic detection of Quest 2
   - Performance monitoring and adjustment
   - Optional quality modes for user preference

## Contest Relevance

This project specifically addresses the contest requirements:

1. **John Carmack Judging Considerations**
   - Performance-first approach
   - Low-level optimizations
   - Clean, elegant code
   - Innovative use of WebXR

2. **OneShot Game Contest Criteria**
   - Immediate playability (no installation)
   - Optimized for target hardware (Quest 2)
   - Visually stunning within constraints
   - Intuitive control scheme

3. **Technical Excellence**
   - Modular component design
   - Clean DRY principles throughout codebase
   - Extensively commented code
   - Performance testing built-in

## Running the Experience

The experience is available at: https://yourusername.github.io/cosmic-drift-vr/

For optimal experience:
1. Use Oculus Browser on Quest 2
2. Enter full-screen mode
3. Allow WebXR permissions when prompted

## Future Enhancements

If selected for further development:

1. Enhanced procedural generation algorithms
2. Additional interactive elements
3. Narrative elements
4. Sound design
5. Multi-user experience

Thank you for considering Cosmic Drift VR for the contest!
